# BasicCalculator2022
A Calculator:
This app will combine 2 numerical user inputs using the traditional mathematic modifiers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Additionally this calculator will also convert feet to meters as well as tell you how long you have been using the program upon exit.

The easiest way to run this program is by opening the solution in Visual Studio and running the code from there. 

This project is loaded on to GitHub with more than 5 commits.
I created the class User and made an instance of calcUser. The User will input their name and that name is displaed in the program.
The 4 math operators make up the functions of the project filling the reqirement of more 3 or more functions or methods.

This app includes the following features:
    A master loop that lets the user select the operations they wish to perform including exiting the program.
    A conversion tool that converts feet to meters.
    This app collects and displays data based on an external factor by giving the users start time and telling the user how long they've used the app upon exit.

Known issues include:
    An exception that comes up when any number or character is entered before pressing enter to continue.
    The program will throw an exception if an input is entered that is not what the calculator is asking for.

Thank you for evaluating my calculator! I hope you enjoy my first C# project!
